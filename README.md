# Ai-training

example of code using Python and the PyTorch library to build a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) for image recognition, which can be part of the AI project

Remember to replace 'train_data_path' and 'test_data_path' with the actual paths to your training and test image datasets respectively, and set num_classes to the correct number of categories you are classifying. Also, you may need to further optimize the model architecture and training parameters for better performance.
